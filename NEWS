  xfce4-settings-editor a bit.

4.5.92 (Xfce 4.6 beta2)
=======================
- Add an option to disable keyboard settings.
- Default to "Rodent" icon theme instead of "hicolor" (Bug 4545).

  not be safe.
- Make xfce4-settings-helper connect to the session manager and use
  the SmRestartImmediately facility to make sure it keeps running.
  Disable the autostart .desktop file if we were restored from a
  saved session.  Attempt to acquire an X selection on startup to
  ensure multiple copies of the helper aren't running (bug 4577).

  keyboard settings dialogs.
- Don't use g_hash_table_get_keys() which requires GLib 2.14 (bug 4377).
