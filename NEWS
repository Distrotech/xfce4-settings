4.6.1
=====
- Use the folder name for selecting the icon- and style-theme in the
  appearance dialog (bug #4997).
- Make sure inputproto 1.4.2 is available before enabling device
  hotplugging in the code (bug #5084).

4.6.0
=====
- Make the Xrandr dependency optional. If Xrandr is disabled, the
  display plugin won't be compiled at all (bug #4836).
- When stealing a shortcut from another shortcuts provider, clear the 
  shortcut of that provider first.
- Make embedded settings dialogs optional (and disabled by default). 
  They can be turned on using --enable-pluggable-dialogs.
- Don't mark GTK+ stock labels as translatable
- Fix DPI calculation when DPI settings are set to '-1', (eg default) since we 
  can not depend on pango, cairo or fontconfig to do the right thing.
- Fix typing error in the ToolbarStyle default XSETTINGS registry value
- Do not fill the xsettings channel from the settings-dialog, xfsettingsd takes
  care of this.
- Add Gtk/IMModule XSETTINGS key (Bug #4961)

  xfce4-settings-editor a bit.

  children at startup.

  another dialog or with xfconf-query.

  Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese, 
  Norwegian Bokmal, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.

4.5.92 (Xfce 4.6 beta2)
=======================
- Add an option to disable keyboard settings.
- Default to "Rodent" icon theme instead of "hicolor" (Bug 4545).
- Use XfcePosixSignalHandler in xfce4-settings-helper to handle
  signals, since calling gtk_main_quit() from a signal handler may
  not be safe.
- Make xfce4-settings-helper connect to the session manager and use
  the SmRestartImmediately facility to make sure it keeps running.
  Disable the autostart .desktop file if we were restored from a
  saved session.  Attempt to acquire an X selection on startup to
  ensure multiple copies of the helper aren't running (bug 4577).

  keyboard settings dialogs.
- Don't use g_hash_table_get_keys() which requires GLib 2.14 (bug 4377).

- Rework the way keyboard shortcuts are organized. Support default
  shortcuts using /default and /custom base properties.
