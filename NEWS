4.5.90.0 (Xfce 4.6 rc1)

  * Allow the settings manager window to be minimized (bug 4596).

4.5.92 (Xfce 4.6 beta2)

  * Add an option to disable keyboard settings.
  * Default to "Rodent" icon theme instead of "hicolor" (Bug 4545).
  * Use XfcePosixSignalHandler in xfce4-settings-helper to handle
    signals, since calling gtk_main_quit() from a signal handler may
    not be safe.
  * Make xfce4-settings-helper connect to the session manager and use
    the SmRestartImmediately facility to make sure it keeps running.
    Disable the autostart .desktop file if we were restored from a
    saved session.  Attempt to acquire an X selection on startup to
    ensure multiple copies of the helper aren't running (bug 4577).

4.5.91 (Xfce 4.6 beta1)

  * Add workspace name handling to xfce4-settings-helper.
  * Add support for embedding dialogs into xfce4-settings-manager (based
    on the X-XfcePluggable and X-XfceHelpFile desktop file keys).
  * Add embedding support to the accessibility, appearance, mouse and
    keyboard settings dialogs.
  * Don't use g_hash_table_get_keys() which requires GLib 2.14 (bug 4377).
  * Move xfsettingsd from xfconf into xfce4-settings.
  * Rework the way keyboard shortcuts are organized. Support default
    shortcuts using /default and /custom base properties.
  * Add optional UI options to enable/disable sounds in Canberra (bug 4367).
  * Add GUI for selecting/changing the keyboard layout.
  * Translation updates: Dutch, Finnish, German.


4.5.90 (Xfce 4.6 alpha)

  * Initial release.
