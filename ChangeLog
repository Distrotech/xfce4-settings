	* dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade:
	  Same here. Maybe I should also mention that all these dialogs
	  now use XfceTitledDialog instead of GtkDialog and XfceHeading.

	* dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade: Improve
	  the dialog layout. I've chosen 12px for horizontal distance
	  and 6px for horizontal distance between neighboured widgets.
	  All boxes now have a border of 10px expect for those inside
	  notebooks+alignments: they now have a border of 6px.
