	* dialogs/mouse-settings/main.c: Destroy the dialog on exit
	  and Xfce4-mouse-settings in the version information.
	* dialogs/mouse-settings/Makefile.am: Add the G_LOG_DOMAIN
	  for glib warnings, errors and messages in the code.

2008-06-29	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-settings-manager/xfce-settings-manager-dialog.c: 
	  Add 6px border to the scrolled window in order to align it
	  with the dialog buttons.

2008-06-29	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/mouse-settings/mouse-dialog.glade: Change border of
	  toplevel boxes inside notebooks to 12px for the sake of 
	  consistency (thunar does the same). Add bottom padding of
	  alignments below section titles to 6px.

2008-06-29	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-settings-manager/xfce-settings-manager-dialog.c: Dialog
	  default size is 600x400px; Changed window icon name to
	  preferences-desktop instead of xfce4-settings, since that's
	  the default icon name; Don't show the dialog separator.
	  Scrolled window shadow is GTK_SHADOW_IN.
	* xfce4-settings-manager/xfce-settings-manager.desktop.in: Changed
	  Exec to xfce4-settings-manager.
	* dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade: Make window
	  resizable; Put hinting and rgb widgets in a table for proper
	  scaling.
	* dialogs/mouse-settings/mouse-dialog.glade: Expand the icon theme
	  list, not the size/preview widget.
	* dialogs/mouse-settings/main.c: Fix compiler warnings.

2008-06-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade,
	  dialogs/mouse-settings/mouse-dialog.glade: Change maximum
	  border width of all boxes to 6 in order to align the toplevel
	  boxes with the dialog buttons. Update the mouse dialog in
	  the same way as I did with the others before.

2008-06-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* dialogs/keyboard-settings/keyboard-dialog.glade: Same 
	  procedure as before.

2008-06-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* dialogs/accessibility-settings/accessibility-dialog.glade:
	  Same here. Maybe I should also mention that all these dialogs
	  now use XfceTitledDialog instead of GtkDialog and XfceHeading.

2008-06-28	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* dialogs/appearance-settings/appearance-dialog.glade: Improve
	  the dialog layout. I've chosen 12px for horizontal distance
	  and 6px for horizontal distance between neighboured widgets.
	  All boxes now have a border of 10px expect for those inside
	  notebooks+alignments: they now have a border of 6px.
