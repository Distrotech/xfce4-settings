Keyboard settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The default values of the sliders don't make sence. I think we should
    also show the slider value and add a tooltip to the slide what the
    value actually stands for, like in the mouse dialog.
    The maximum values also seem to be a bit high.
  * IMPORTANT (for the final release): Update the property-changed 
    handler so that they it adds a new row for new properties
  * IMPORTANT (for the final release): Don't display Mod2-Mod5. Instead 
    figure out which modifiers are mapped to them and unmask the modifier
    bits before calling gtk_accelerator_name(). Update 
    xfce4-settings-helper according to this as well (just the other way
    around).


Mouse Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Figure out the needed Xi and Xcursor dependency version.


Settings Helper
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Check for an already running instance. This is quite easy with
    a pid file, but I'm not sure that's a good solution...


Display Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Make it all work for individual screens.
  * Simple dual screen support (2 monitors only).
  * Figure out the needed Xrandr and Xxf86vm dependency version.
  * Maybe some sort of stored configurations for different setups
    (probably not in 4.6).
  * Hotplug support. Notify the user (with button to change the
    display settings). Could be integrated with the stored configs.
