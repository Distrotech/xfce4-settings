Keyboard settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The default values of the sliders don't make sence. I think we should
    also show the slider value and add a tooltip to the slide what the
    value actually stands for, like in the mouse dialog.
    The maximum values also seem to be a bit high.
 (* Not before the 4.6 alpha: Maybe add support for keyboard themes 
    again) (Jannis)


Accessibility Settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Also show the values of the sliders and add tooltips.


Mouse Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Figure out the needed Xi and Xcursor dependency version.


Settings Helper
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add signal watch to xfce4-setting-helper to quit the main loop when
    receiving a sigterm. (Nick)


Display Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Make it all work for individual screens.
  * Simple dual screen support (2 monitors only).
  * Figure out the needed Xrandr and Xxf86vm dependency version.
  * Maybe some sort of stored configurations for different setups
    (probably not in 4.6).
  * Hotplug support. Notify the user (with button to change the
    display settings). Could be integrated with the stored configs.
